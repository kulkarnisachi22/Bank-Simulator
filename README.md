# Bank-Simulator
I made this project - Bank Simulator in Semester 2 of my B.Tech, with the help of my team member - Preeti Jyotsna.

A user in the existing database (Comma Separated Values File - csv file) can login by entering their USERNAME and PASSWORD.
Once logged in, the user can do the following operations - 
(1) Deposit:
    The entered amount of money is added to the user's account.
    
(2) Withdraw:
    The entered amount of money is taken out of the user's account.
    
(3) Fund Transfer:
    The entered amount of money is taken out of the user's account and added to entered receiver's account.
    
After the successful execution of the either of the above mentioned operations, a bill receipt is generated.
